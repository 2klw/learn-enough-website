        The <a href="https://www.softcover.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Softcover</a> publishing platform was designed mainly for eBooks like the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</em> book</a> and <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Learn Enough HTML to be Dangerous</em></a>, but it's also good for making more traditional books, such as the novel <em>Moby-Dick</em> by Herman Melville (sometimes written as <em>Moby Dick</em>). We present below a short and affectionately irreverent book report on this classic of American literature.

        <a href="https://www.softcover.io/read/6070fb03/moby-dick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Moby-Dick</em></a> by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some year's ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After driving off his spleen (which <em>can't</em> be good for you), Ishmael then goes on in much the same vein for approximately one million pages. The only thing bigger than Moby-Dick is the book itself.
